        "\n",
        "- **No semantic meaning**: One-hot vectors don't capture relationships between words.\n",
        "- **High dimensionality**: For large vocabularies, these vectors become very sparse and memory intensive.\n",
        "\n",
        "Embeddings address these issues by representing words as dense vectors, capturing semantic meaning and relationships between words. Similar words (e.g., \"king\" and \"queen\") have similar vectors, making it easier for computers to understand and process text data.\n",
        "\n",
        "# How embedding works?\n",
        "Embeddings are a way to represent words or phrases as vectors of real numbers in a continuous vector space. This representation captures semantic meaning, allowing similar words to have similar vector representations. Here's a high-level overview of how embeddings work:\n",
        "- **Initialization**: Embeddings are typically initialized with random values or pre-trained vectors (like Word2Vec, GloVe, or FastText).\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Training: During** training, the embeddings are adjusted based on the context in which words appear. This is done using neural networks, such as:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Word2Vec**: Uses either Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) or Skip-gram models to predict a word based on its context or vice versa.\n",
        "- **GloVeV**: Uses global word-word co-occurrence statistics to create embeddings.\n",
        "- **FastText**: Extends Word2Vec by considering subword information, which helps with rare words and misspellings.\n",
        "- **Vector Space**: After training, each word is represented as a point in a high-dimensional space. Words with similar meanings are close to each other in this space.\n",
        "\n",
        "Usage: These embeddings can be used in various NLP tasks, such as text classification, sentiment analysis, and machine translation, by feeding them into machine learning models.\n",
        "\n",
        "# What can we do with embeddings?\n",

        "Embeddings have a wide range of applications in NLP and machine learning, such as:\n",

        "1. **Text Classification**: Representing text data for tasks like sentiment analysis and spam detection.\n",
        "2. **Similarity Measurement**: Comparing vector representations of words or documents for clustering and recommendation systems.\n",
